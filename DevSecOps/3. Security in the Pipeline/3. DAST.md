## Overview of DAST

- **Definition:**  
  - **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** tests a running web application by simulating real-world attacks in a **black-box** manner.
  - It identifies runtime vulnerabilities (e.g., configuration issues, HTTP request smuggling, cache poisoning) that other testing methods (like SAST) might miss.

- **Purpose:**  
  - Discover vulnerabilities that appear only when the application is running.
  - Complement other security testing techniques (manual pentesting and static code analysis) as part of a secure development lifecycle.

- **Key Benefit:**  
  - **Language-Agnostic:** Works on applications regardless of the underlying technology stack.

## Manual vs. Automated DAST

- **Manual DAST:**  
  - **Conducted by:** Security engineers.
  - **Pros:**  
    - Tailored testing that can uncover complex business logic flaws.
  - **Cons:**  
    - Time-consuming when applied to every minor change.

- **Automated DAST:**  
  - **Uses:** Specialized tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP).
  - **Pros:**  
    - Fast and repeatable; ideal for integration with continuous deployment.
  - **Cons:**  
    - May overlook vulnerabilities that require human insight.

- **Combined Approach:**  
  - Integrating both methods throughout the SDLC yields the best results.

## DAST in the SDLC

- **Testing Phases:**  
  - **Automated Scans:** Run during development or testing phases to catch “low-hanging fruit.”
  - **Manual Scans:** Performed periodically or before production release for in-depth evaluation.

- **Example Tool – OWASP ZAP:**  
  - Provides functionalities for both automated scanning (spidering, active scanning) and manual testing (with authentication support).

## Spidering & Crawling

- **Spidering:**  
  - **Goal:** Map out all accessible URLs and parameters.
  - **Techniques:**  
    - **Regular Spider:** Follows HTML links but may miss dynamically generated content.
    - **AJAX Spider:** Uses a real browser (e.g., Firefox) to process JavaScript, discovering dynamic links.
  - **Real-Life Example:**  
    - A modern web application might generate links (e.g., `/nospiders-gallery.php`) via JavaScript. The AJAX Spider ensures these hidden endpoints are discovered.

## Vulnerability Scanning

- **Scan Policy Configuration:**  
  - **Threshold:** Adjusts sensitivity; lower thresholds find more issues (with risk of false positives), higher thresholds reduce noise.
  - **Strength:** Determines the number of tests performed per category.
  - **Tip:** Customize policies to your application. If your app does not use SQL databases, disable SQL injection tests to speed up the scan.

- **Active Scanning:**  
  - Sends malicious payloads to discovered endpoints.
  - Alerts are reviewed and false positives can be manually marked.

## Authenticated Scans & Context Configuration

- **Purpose:**  
  - Test areas of the application that require login credentials.
  
- **Using ZAP’s "Include in Context" Command:**  
  - **Steps:**  
    - Right-click the base URL in the ZAP **Sites** tab.
    - Select **"Include in Context" → "New Context"** to group related URLs.
    - This ensures that all pages under the context use the same authentication settings.
  - **Real-Life Example:**  
    - Record the login flow via a ZEST script (using credentials `nospiders/nospiders`), then include all authenticated pages in one context while excluding pages like `/logout.php` to avoid accidental session termination.
  
- **Additional Setup:**  
  - **Logged-In/Logged-Out Indicators:**  
    - Define HTML markers (like a logout link) to help ZAP verify session validity.
  - **Authentication Verification:**  
    - Configure periodic checks (e.g., polling `/aboutme.php`) to know when to renew authentication.

## API Testing with DAST

- **Challenges with APIs:**  
  - APIs aren’t easily spidered because endpoints may not expose links to other endpoints.
- **Approach:**  
  - **Import API Specifications:**  
    - Use standards such as OpenAPI (Swagger), SOAP, or GraphQL to import endpoint definitions.
  - **Real-Life Example:**  
    - An endpoint defined as `/asciiart/{art_id}` in an OpenAPI file clearly indicates the required GET parameter `art_id`.
- **Scanning:**  
  - Once imported, APIs are scanned in the same way as a regular web application.

## Integrating DAST into the CI/CD Pipeline

- **Continuous Security:**  
  - Automate vulnerability scanning on each commit to provide early visibility of issues.
- **Pipeline Components:**  
  - **Gitea:** Hosts the code repository.
  - **Jenkins:** Runs the CI/CD process, building and deploying Docker containers.
- **Scan Stages in the Pipeline:**  
  - **Build Stage:** Compiles the Docker image.
  - **Deploy Stage:** Deploys the container.
  - **Scan Stage:** (Often added as a third stage) runs zap2docker to initiate the security scan.

## Using zap2docker for Automated Scanning

- **Installing zap2docker:**  
  - Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub using the following command:  
    ```
    docker pull owasp/zap2docker-stable
    ```

- **Scan Profiles (Commands):**

  - **Baseline Scan:**  
    - **Description:**  
      - Spider the target website for 1 minute; no active scan is performed. Optionally, run an AJAX spider.
    - **Command:**  
      ```
      docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t https://www.example.com
      ```

  - **Full Scan:**  
    - **Description:**  
      - Runs an unlimited spider to map the site, followed by an active scan.
    - **Command:**  
      ```
      docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-full-scan.py -t https://www.example.com
      ```

  - **API Scan:**  
    - **Description:**  
      - Performs an active scan using an API description file (OpenAPI, GraphQL, or SOAP).
    - **Command:**  
      ```
      docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-api-scan.py -t https://www.example.com/swagger.json -f openapi
      ```

- **Note:**  
  - You can optionally add the `-j` switch to the baseline and full scans to trigger an AJAX scan.
- **Real-Life Integration:**  
  - In a Jenkins pipeline, you can add a stage that runs one of these zap2docker commands (for example, the Baseline Scan for quick feedback on every commit). The scan results are stored (often in a `zap-reports` folder) so that vulnerabilities can be reviewed and remediated immediately.

## Summary & Key Takeaways

- **DAST** is essential for finding runtime vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks.

  - Both methods have unique advantages; a combined approach is optimal.
- **Core Processes:**  
  - **Spidering/Crawling:** Maps application endpoints.
  - **Active Scanning:** Probes endpoints with various attack payloads.
  - **Authenticated Scans:** Leverage the **Include in Context** command to group URLs and apply authentication settings.
- **API Testing:** Leverage API definitions to scan endpoints that aren’t easily discoverable.
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  - Automate scans using zap2docker commands:
    - Pull the image: `docker pull owasp/zap2docker-stable`
    - Run Baseline, Full, or API scans using the provided commands.
  - This automation provides continuous security feedback, ensuring that vulnerabilities are detected early in the development process.
