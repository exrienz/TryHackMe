# **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Cheatsheet**

## **1. Overview of SAST**  

### **Definition**  
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is an automated method for analyzing source code to detect security vulnerabilities without executing the application. It is also known as **static code analysis** or **white-box testing**.

### **Purpose**  
- Identify security flaws early in the development process.  
- Complement other security techniques such as:  
  - **DAST** (Dynamic Application Security Testing)  
  - **SCA** (Software Composition Analysis)

## **2. Manual Code Review for Security**  

### **What is Manual Code Review?**  
A systematic examination of source code to identify potential vulnerabilities. It follows a **white-box approach**, analyzing code for insecure coding patterns, logical flow, and context.  

### **Key Steps in Manual Code Review**  

#### **1. Identify Insecure Functions**  
- Search for functions that directly interact with external inputs or critical operations, such as database queries.  
- **Example Command:**  
  ```bash
  grep -r -n 'mysqli_query(' /path/to/project
  ```

#### **2. Analyze the Context**  
- Open the matching files and analyze how these functions are used.  
- Trace the flow of user input to check for potential vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized GET/POST parameters.  

#### **3. Trace Data Flow**  
- Follow how user-controlled data (sources) flows into critical functions (sinks).  
- **Example:** A GET parameter concatenated into an SQL query without sanitization can lead to **SQL Injection**.

## **3. Automated Code Review with SAST Tools**  

### **What is Automated SAST?**  
SAST tools analyze code structures for security issues. These tools offer fast, consistent analysis and integrate well with CI/CD pipelines.  

### **Pros and Cons of SAST**  

| **Pros**                              | **Cons**                            |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| No need to execute the application     | Limited to source-accessible code   |
| Fast and consistent analysis           | Language-specific                   |
| Easy integration into CI/CD pipelines  | Susceptible to false positives      |

## **4. SAST Analysis Techniques**  

### **1. Semantic Analysis**  
Detects insecure functions and direct input concatenation.  
**Example:**  
```php
mysqli_query($db, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=" . $_GET['username']);
```

### **2. Dataflow Analysis**  
Tracks user-controlled data from sources (e.g., GET/POST inputs) to critical sinks (e.g., database queries).  
**Example:** Unvalidated input flows into `db_query()`, which wraps `mysqli_query()`.  

### **3. Control Flow Analysis**  
Analyzes the code’s execution sequences to detect issues such as uninitialized variables, race conditions, and resource leaks.  

### **4. Configuration Analysis**  
Reviews configuration files (e.g., `php.ini`) for insecure settings, such as `allow_url_include = On`.

## **5. Real-Life Code Example: LFI Injection**  

### **Exercise:** Detect Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerabilities  

1. **Objective:** Identify vulnerabilities related to **file inclusion functions** (`require`, `include`) in a PHP project.  
2. **Approach:** Ensure input sanitization and validation to prevent LFI attacks.  

#### **Example Setup and Command Usage**  

- **Navigate to the Source Code Directory:**  
  ```bash
  cd /ProjectQ/src/
  ```
- **Rationale:** Searching within the `/src/` folder reduces false positives by focusing only on relevant files.  

#### **Search for Vulnerable Code:**  
```bash
grep -r -n --include \*.php 'require('  
grep -r -n --include \*.php 'include('  
grep -r -n --include \*.php 'require_once('  
grep -r -n --include \*.php 'include_once('  
```

#### **Explanation of Command Options:**  
- **`-r`**: Recursive search within subdirectories  
- **`-n`**: Show line numbers for matches  
- **`--include \*.php`**: Limit search to PHP files  

### **Interpreting the Output**  

**Example Output:**  
```bash
view.php:22:include('./gallery-files/'.$_GET['img']);
```

**Analysis:**  
- **File:** `view.php`, **Line:** 22 — The `include` function directly uses the `$_GET['img']` input.  
- **Risk:** Unsanitized user input can lead to **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**.  

**Best Practices:**  
- **Sanitize and validate inputs** before passing them to file inclusion functions.  
- **Mitigation Example:** Use a whitelist of allowed filenames or sanitize input using `basename()`.

## **6. SAST Tools in Practice**  

### **Psalm**  
- **Usage:** Run with `--taint-analysis` for dataflow issues.  
- **Features:** Detects type errors, incorrect comparisons, and security issues.  
- **Example:** Add `@psalm-taint-sink` annotations to mark functions like `db_query()` for analysis.  

### **Semgrep**  
- **Integration:** Available as a VS Code plugin for real-time scanning.  
- **Benefit:** Inline alerts reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities during development.

## **7. SAST in the Development Lifecycle**  

- **Early Detection:** Apply SAST during the coding phase for immediate feedback.  
- **CI/CD Integration:** Run scans on pull requests to ensure secure code deployment.  
- **IDE Integration:** Tools like Psalm and Semgrep provide instant feedback within the developer's environment.

## **8. Practical Tips for Effective SAST**  

1. **Balance Manual and Automated Reviews:** Use SAST for fast checks; rely on manual reviews for complex logic and business rules.  
2. **Sanitize Inputs:** Ensure thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks.  
3. **Customize Tool Configuration:** Reduce false positives by configuring tools appropriately and using annotations where necessary.
