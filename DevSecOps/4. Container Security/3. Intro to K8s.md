## 1. Introduction & Background

- **Emergence of Kubernetes**  
  - **Monolithic vs. Microservices:**  
    - Traditional applications were built as one single, monolithic unit.  
    - Companies (e.g., Netflix in 2009) moved to microservices to scale high-demand components independently.
  - **The Role of Containers:**  
    - Microservices run as individual containers.
    - Need arose for a system to manage hundreds or thousands of containers efficiently.

- **What is Kubernetes?**  
  - An open‑source **container orchestration system**.
  - Acts as the “conductor” to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.
  - Ensures high availability, scalability, and load balancing by automating container management.

## 2. Kubernetes Architecture

### A. Core Concepts

- **Cluster:**  
  - A set of nodes (machines) working together.
  
- **Nodes:**  
  - **Control Plane (Master Node):**  
    - Manages the overall Kubernetes cluster.
    - **Key Components:**
      - **kube-apiserver:** Exposes the Kubernetes API; handles incoming REST requests.
      - **etcd:** A durable key/value store saving cluster state.
      - **kube-scheduler:** Assigns new pods to available nodes based on resource criteria.
      - **kube-controller-manager:** Runs controllers (e.g., node controller that replaces failed nodes).
      - **cloud-controller-manager:** Integrates with external cloud-provider APIs.
  - **Worker Nodes:**  
    - Run your application’s pods.
    - **Key Components:**
      - **Kubelet:** Ensures containers within pods run as expected.
      - **Kube-proxy:** Manages networking rules to allow communication with pods.
      - **Container Runtime:** Software (e.g., Docker, runC) to run containers.

### B. Kubernetes Resources

- **Pods:**  
  - Smallest deployable unit; a group of one or more containers sharing storage and network.
  
- **ReplicaSet & Deployments:**  
  - **ReplicaSet:** Manages a set number of identical pods to ensure availability.
  - **Deployments:** Declare a **desired state** for pods and automatically manage ReplicaSets.
  
- **StatefulSets:**  
  - For stateful applications (e.g., databases) that require unique, persistent identities.
  - Maintains an order (master vs. slave pods) and stable network identities.
  
- **Services:**  
  - Provide a stable networking endpoint despite the dynamic nature of pods.  
  - **Types:** ClusterIP (default), NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName.
  
- **Ingress:**  
  - Acts as a single access point to expose multiple services.
  - Routes external traffic to appropriate backend services based on defined rules.
  
- **Namespaces:**  
  - Logical partitions within a cluster to isolate resources (e.g., by team or application).

## 3. YAML Configuration

### A. Basics of a Kubernetes YAML File

- **Required Fields:**
  - **apiVersion:** Indicates the version of the Kubernetes API.
  - **kind:** The type of object (e.g., Deployment, Service).
  - **metadata:** Contains information such as name and namespace.
  - **spec:** Defines the desired state (e.g., number of replicas, container image).

### B. Real-Life Configuration Examples

- **Service Example (example-service.yaml):**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: example-nginx-service
  spec:
    selector:
      app: nginx
    ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 8080
        targetPort: 80
    type: ClusterIP
  ```

  - **Key Points:**
    - The service targets pods with the label `app: nginx`.
    - Exposes port 8080 externally while sending traffic to container port 80.

- **Deployment Example (example-deployment.yaml):**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: example-nginx-deployment
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: nginx
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: nginx
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  ```

  - **Key Points:**
    - Declares 3 identical pods behind a ReplicaSet.
    - Labels in both deployment and service ensure proper mapping.

## 4. Essential Kubectl Commands

**kubectl** is the command-line tool to interact with the Kubernetes API server. Below are commonly used commands:

- **Deploying Configuration:**  
  - `kubectl apply -f <filename>`  
    - Example: `kubectl apply -f example-deployment.yaml`
  
- **Retrieving Resource Status:**  
  - `kubectl get`  
    - Example: `kubectl get pods -n example-namespace`
  
- **Describing Resources in Detail:**  
  - `kubectl describe <resource-type> <resource-name> -n <namespace>`  
    - Example: `kubectl describe pod example-pod -n example-namespace`
  
- **Viewing Logs:**  
  - `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>`  
    - Essential for troubleshooting or security analysis.
  
- **Accessing a Pod’s Shell:**  
  - `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- sh`
  
- **Port-Forwarding for Local Testing:**  
  - `kubectl port-forward service/<service-name> <local-port>:<target-port>`  
    - Example: `kubectl port-forward service/example-nginx-service 8090:8080`  
    - Useful to access a web application running in a pod via `http://localhost:8090`.

*When asked, “What command would follow ‘kubectl’ if you wanted to …”, keep these options in mind based on the task:*

- **Apply configuration:** `apply`
- **List resources:** `get`
- **Inspect resource details:** `describe`
- **Check logs:** `logs`
- **Enter a container:** `exec`
- **Expose local port:** `port-forward`

## 5. Kubernetes Security & Hardening

### A. Securing Pods & Containers

- **Best Practices:**
  - Avoid running containers as **root**.
  - Use an **immutable filesystem** when possible.
  - Regularly **scan container images** for vulnerabilities.
  - Prevent usage of **privileged containers**.

### B. Network Security

- **Isolation & Protection:**
  - Restrict access to the **control plane** with firewalls and strict access controls.
  - Use **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** for inter-component communication.
  - Implement an explicit **deny policy** to block unwanted traffic.

### C. Authentication & Authorization

- **Key Recommendations:**
  - **Disable anonymous access.**
  - Enforce **strong user authentication** methods.
  - Use **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to define precise permissions.

### D. Managing Secrets

- **Secrets Features:**
  - **Kubernetes Secrets** store sensitive data (passwords, tokens, keys) as base64 encoded strings.
  - **Encryption at rest:** Configure to prevent plain-text exposure.
  - Apply **least privilege access** using RBAC to protect secrets.

### E. Auditing and Continuous Security

- **Logging & Monitoring:**
  - Enable **audit logging** to track API calls and events.
  - Set up log monitoring and alerting systems.
- **Regular Maintenance:**
  - Apply security patches quickly.
  - Conduct periodic vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
  - Remove obsolete components from the cluster.

## 6. DevOps vs. DevSecOps in Kubernetes

- **DevOps Tasks:**  
  - Building and managing the cluster.
  - Configuring deployments, services, and infrastructure.
  
- **DevSecOps Tasks:**  
  - Securing the Kubernetes environment.
  - Enforcing RBAC, managing secrets, and hardening pods.
  - Continuous monitoring and vulnerability management.

## 7. Real-Life Examples

- **Netflix’s Transformation:**  
  - Faced with scaling issues in a monolithic architecture, Netflix pioneered the shift to **microservices** and ultimately drove the need for container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
  
- **Using Kubectl in Practice:**  
  - Deploying an **nginx web server**: Define a deployment and a service using YAML, then expose the app locally via `kubectl port-forward service/example-nginx-service 8090:8080`.
  - Troubleshooting by accessing logs (`kubectl logs`) or entering the container (`kubectl exec -it <pod> -- sh`) to run configuration tests or security checks.
