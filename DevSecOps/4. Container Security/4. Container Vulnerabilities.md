# Container Vulnerabilities Cheat Sheet

## Introduction
- **Containers Overview**
  - Containers are isolated, minimal environments designed to run applications.
  - They include only what a developer specifies (e.g., no Netcat, Wget, or even Bash).
  - **Key Point:** A foothold in a container does not automatically give access to the host OS or other containers.

- **Common Vulnerability Themes**
  - **Hard-coded Credentials:** Sensitive data (e.g., database usernames/passwords) might be embedded in application code.
  - **Misconfiguration:** Containers given unnecessary privileges or improper network settings can be exploited.
  - **Image Vulnerabilities:** Docker images can be backdoored or contain exploitable flaws.
  - **Lateral Movement:** Once compromised, a container may be used to pivot and access other containers or the host.

*Real-life Example:* An attacker gains access via a vulnerable web application and finds hard-coded credentials (e.g., `DB_PASSWORD = 'SuperstrongPassword321!'`) that allow additional access or data exfiltration.

## Vulnerability 1: Privileged Containers (Capabilities)

### Key Concepts
- **Linux Capabilities:**  
  - Granular privileges granted to a process rather than full root access.
  - Containers can run in either **normal (user)** mode or **privileged** mode.
- **Privilege Differences:**  
  - **Normal Mode:** Communicates with the OS through the Docker Engine.
  - **Privileged Mode:** Bypasses the Docker Engine, granting direct communication with the host.

### Exploitation Overview
- **Capability Listing:**  
  - Use `capsh --print` to see assigned capabilities (e.g., `cap_sys_admin`, `cap_sys_module`).
- **Mount-based Exploit:**  
  - By leveraging the `mount` syscall (permitted by the container’s capabilities), an attacker can manipulate control groups (cgroups) to escalate privileges.
  - **Exploit Steps in Brief:**
    1. **Create a cgroup mount**: `mkdir /tmp/cgrp && mount -t cgroup -o rdma cgroup /tmp/cgrp`
    2. **Signal Exploit Execution:** Write to `/tmp/cgrp/x/notify_on_release`.
    3. **Determine Host Path:** Extract from `/etc/mtab`.
    4. **Prepare Exploit File:** Write a payload (could be a reverse shell) to `/exploit` and configure a release agent.
    5. **Trigger the Payload:** Execute using the cgroup release mechanism.
    
*Real-life Example:* An attacker uses these steps to pivot from a container to execute commands as root on the host, like reading a sensitive flag file.

## Vulnerability 2: Escaping via Exposed Docker Daemon (Unix Sockets)

### Key Concepts
- **Docker Socket Usage:**
  - Docker commands communicate over a **Unix socket** (typically found at `/var/run/docker.sock`).
  - Access to this socket (as root or via the Docker group) allows for direct interaction with the Docker Engine.
- **Inter-process Communication (IPC):**
  - Unix sockets enable fast IPC and rely on file system permissions.

### Exploitation Overview
- **Locating the Socket:**
  - Confirm the existence with: `ls -la /var/run | grep sock`
- **Exploitation Command (Example):**
  - Use the Docker socket to launch a new container while mounting the host filesystem:
    ```
    docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
    ```
  - This command creates a new container that uses the host’s filesystem, effectively escaping container isolation.

*Real-life Example:* An attacker with access to a container exposes the host by running the above command, thereby getting a shell on the host system.

## Vulnerability 3: Remote Code Execution via Exposed Docker Daemon (TCP Sockets)

### Key Concepts
- **Docker TCP Exposure:**
  - Docker Engine can be configured to listen on a TCP port (default is **2375**).
  - Improperly secured, this allows remote attackers to execute Docker commands.
- **Enumeration and Exploitation:**
  - **Enumeration:**  
    - Scan for open port `2375` using Nmap.
    - Verify by checking version info with `curl http://MACHINE_IP:2375/version`.
  - **Remote Command Execution:**
    - Execute commands like `docker -H tcp://MACHINE_IP:2375 ps` to list containers.
    - Once accessible, attackers can create, modify, or remove containers living on the host.

*Real-life Example:* A remote attacker scans for exposed Docker daemons and, finding one, uses the API to list or even run new containers to further exploit the system.

## Vulnerability 4: Abusing Namespaces

### Key Concepts
- **Linux Namespaces:**
  - Isolate system resources (processes, files, networks) between the host and container.
  - Every process is assigned a namespace and a **Process Identifier (PID)**.
  - Containers typically run with very few processes (often a single main process with PID 1).

### Exploitation Overview
- **Detecting Container vs. Host Processes:**
  - On a full OS, many processes run (e.g., multiple Firefox processes). In a container, only a handful exist.
- **Namespace Exploit with nsenter:**
  - **nsenter:** Tool to enter the namespace of another process.
  - **Exploit Command:**
    ```
    nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net /bin/bash
    ```
    - **--target 1:** Targets process ID 1 (typically the host’s init/systemd).
    - **--mount, --uts, --ipc, --net:** Enters the corresponding namespaces, allowing sharing of mounts, hostname, IPC, and network.
    - **Result:** Spawns a shell with the same privileges as the host’s init process.

*Real-life Example:* An attacker notices that the container can see the host’s PID 1 and uses `nsenter` to open a shell on the host, achieving full host access.

## Final Tips
- **Minimize Privileges:**  
  - Run containers in normal mode with only necessary capabilities.
- **Avoid Exposing Docker Daemon:**  
  - Do not bind Docker to TCP without proper security measures.
- **Network Segregation:**  
  - Ensure containers only have network access to intended endpoints.
- **Monitor Image Integrity:**  
  - Use trusted and up-to-date images to prevent backdoored containers.
