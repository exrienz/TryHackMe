# The Story of Git & Secure Development Practices

## 1. Git's Origins and Evolution

- **Creative Destruction and Controversy**
  - Early Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002) relied on patches and archived files.
  - BitKeeper, a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), was introduced in 2002 for Linux kernel development.
  - In 2005, due to strained relations with BitKeeper’s creator Larry McVoy, the Linux community lost access to BitKeeper.

- **Birth of Git**
  - **Linus Torvalds**, the creator of Linux, initiated Git in 2005.
  - **Released in April 2005** to address large-scale, distributed development needs.
  - Designed for developers to work from anywhere and merge changes easily.
  - **Influenced by:** BitKeeper, Subversion, and Monotone.

- **Global Impact**
  - Git has evolved into one of the most popular version control systems.
  - Millions of developers across diverse industries use Git for source code management.

## 2. Benefits of Git

- **Open-Source:**  
  - Freely available for contributions and improvements.
  
- **Performance:**  
  - Focuses on file contents rather than their names, enhancing speed.
  
- **Security:**  
  - Uses hashing mechanisms to protect code and history integrity.
  
- **Wide Adoption:**  
  - Chosen by many organizations as their primary version control system.

## 3. Understanding Version Control

- **Basic Concepts:**
  - **Repository:**  
    - A database that stores every change along with a working copy.
  - **Working Copy (Checkout):**  
    - A personal copy where developers can make and test changes.
  - **Commit:**  
    - Saving a snapshot of changes, along with author details and messages.

- **Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control:**
  - **Centralized VCS:**  
    - A single repository where commits are immediately visible to everyone.
  - **Distributed VCS:**  
    - Each user holds a full repository copy; changes are pushed to a central location.

- **Popular Systems:**
  - **Git, Mercurial:**  
    - Distributed systems offering advanced capabilities and faster performance.
  - **Subversion:**  
    - A centralized version control system.

## 4. Cloud-based Version Control Platforms

### GitHub

- **Overview:**
  - Founded in 2007 by Chris Wanstrath, P.J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon.
  - Built with Ruby on Rails.
  - Known as the first open-source code repository on the web.
  - Hosts millions of projects and facilitates code review and collaboration.

- **GitHub Actions and CI/CD:**
  - Launched in 2018.
  - Allows the definition of **Workflows** that automate building, testing, and deployment.
  - Example activities include pushing code, issue creation, and new release deployments.

### GitLab

- **Overview:**
  - Founded in 2014 by Dmitriy Zaporozhets and Sytse Sijbrandij.
  - An all-in-one DevOps platform combining development, security, and operations.
  - Integrates a full set of CI/CD tools built in by default.
  - Offers advanced features such as multiple stable branches for better release management.

- **CI/CD with GitLab:**
  - Uses **runners** (agents) to execute jobs and automate pipelines.
  - Provides features like a built-in container registry and automatic Kubernetes deployment.
  - Enhances security by integrating secret management directly into the workflow.

## 5. Secure Credential Management

### The Importance of Credential Hygiene

- **Risks of Hard-coded Credentials:**
  - Exposes sensitive authentication details.
  - Increases vulnerability if access to source code is compromised.
  
- **Best Practices for Credential Management:**
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  
    - Each component or developer uses only the minimum required privileges.
  - **Credential Rotation:**  
    - Regularly update credentials to prevent stale or compromised keys.
  - **Restricted Sharing:**  
    - Avoid using the same credentials across multiple environments.

### Using Environment Variables

- **Why Use Environment Variables?**
  - Store **key-value pairs** that hold sensitive data such as API keys and passwords.
  - Separate configuration from code to avoid exposing credentials in source files.

- **Example Change in Code (Go):**

  Instead of hardcoding credentials:
  ```go
  func init() {
      apiURL = "https://example.com"
      username = "admin"
      password = "p@ssw0rd"
  }
  ```
  Replace with:
  ```go
  import (
      "os"
  )
  
  func init() {
      apiURL = "https://example.com"
      username = os.Getenv("GITLAB_USERNAME")
      password = os.Getenv("GITLAB_PASSWORD")
  }
  ```

- **Benefits of Using os.Getenv():**
  - Improves source code security.
  - Facilitates easy updates or rotations of credentials without code changes.

## 6. Essential Git Commands and Branching Techniques

- **Cloning a Repository:**
  - `git clone <repository_url>`
  - Use `-branch` option to clone a specific branch:
    ```
    git clone -branch name_of_branch <repository_url>
    ```

- **Branching in Git:**
  - **Create and switch to a new branch:**
    ```
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```
  - **List branches:**
    - For local branches: `git branch`
    - For remote branches: `git branch -r`
    - For both: `git branch -a`

- **Working with Changes:**
  - **Add changes:**  
    - `git add <filename>`
  - **Commit changes with a message:**  
    - `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
  - **Push changes to the remote repository:**
    - `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

### 7. GitLab Secret Management & CI/CD Integration

**Implementation Example:**  
*Storing Secrets:*
1. In your GitLab project, navigate to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**
2. Add variables like `DB_PASSWORD` or `API_KEY` with values
3. Enable **"Mask variable"** to prevent accidental log exposure
4. Enable **"Protect variable"** to restrict access to protected branches

*Accessing Secrets in Code (Go Example):*
```go
package main

import (
    "os"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    dbPassword := os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
    fmt.Println("Connecting to database...")
    // Use password in your application logic
}
```
